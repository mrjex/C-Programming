# C-Programming

In 2024, January-March, I attended the course [Development of Embedded & Real-Time Systems](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-2/5.%20Development%20of%20Embedded%20&%20Real-Time%20Systems?ref_type=heads) where I worked with C-algorithms and Tinkercad. Eventually, at the end of the course we worked with real hardware components and used our the electrical connections we made in Tinkercad as a simulation of debugging

This file contains my own algorithm that I came up with after I completed the course [Development of Embedded & Real-Time Systems](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-2/5.%20Development%20of%20Embedded%20&%20Real-Time%20Systems?ref_type=heads). My other C-programming experience can be found in the directory of the 'Development of Embedded & Real-Time Systems'


## Bitpacking and Bitwise Operations

Furthermore, I familiarized myself with the concepts of Bitpacking and Bitwise operations and gained hands-on practical experience in my repository [Binary Coding Practices](https://github.com/mrjex/Embedded-and-Real-Time-Systems/tree/main/code/binary-coding-practice)
