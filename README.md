## Overview

In the spring of 2024, through the [Embedded & Real-Time Systems](https://github.com/mrjex/Embedded-and-Real-Time-Systems) project. The journey progressed from algorithmic implementations to hardware integration using TinkerCad simulations and physical components. This repository shows my individual pursuit of gaining more knowledge in the field of low-level programming.

## Custom Algorithm Implementation

The `joel-algorithm.c` file showcases my original algorithm developed post-course completion, demonstrating practical application of learned concepts and creative problem-solving in C.

## Binary Operations

Explored advanced low-level programming concepts including:
- Bitpacking techniques
- Bitwise operations
- Binary manipulation

Additional practical implementations are available in my [Binary Coding Practices](https://github.com/mrjex/Embedded-and-Real-Time-Systems/tree/main/binary-coding-practice) repository.
