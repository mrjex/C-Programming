## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

During January-March 2024, I deepened my understanding of C programming through the [Embedded & Real-Time Systems](https://github.com/mrjex/Embedded-and-Real-Time-Systems) course. The journey progressed from algorithmic implementations to hardware integration using TinkerCad simulations and physical components.

## ðŸ’¡ Custom Algorithm Implementation

The `joel-algorithm.c` file showcases my original algorithm developed post-course completion, demonstrating practical application of learned concepts and creative problem-solving in C.

## âš¡ Binary Operations

Explored advanced low-level programming concepts including:
- Bitpacking techniques
- Bitwise operations
- Binary manipulation

Additional practical implementations are available in my [Binary Coding Practices](https://github.com/mrjex/Embedded-and-Real-Time-Systems/tree/main/binary-coding-practice) repository.
